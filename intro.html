<h2>Introduction:</h2>
In computer engineering,computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems.
Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation.

A general-purpose computer has these parts:
processor: the ``brain'' that does arithmetic, responds to incoming information, and generates outgoing information
primary storage (memory or RAM): the ``scratchpad'' that remembers information that can be used by the processor. It is connected to the processor by a system bus (wiring).
system and expansion busses: the transfer mechanisms (wiring plus connectors) that connect the processor to primary storage and input/output devices.
A computer usually comes with several input/output devices: For input: a keyboard, a mouse; For output, a display (monitor), a printer; For both input and output: an internal disk drive, memory key, CD reader/writer, etc., as well as connections to external networks.
For reasons of speed, primary storage is connected ``more closely'' to the processor than are the input/output devices. Most of the devices (e.g., internal disk, printer) are themselves primitive computers in the sense that they contain simple processors that help transfer information to/from the processor to/from the device.

Here is a simple picture that summarizes the above:
