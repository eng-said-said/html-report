Software is a collection of instructions and data that tell a computer how to work.
 This is in contrast to physical hardware, from which the system is built and actually performs the work.
 In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems,
 including programs and data. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data,
 such as online documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.

At the lowest programming level,
 executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU). 
A machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state.
 For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. 
 An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the user.
 The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to "jump" to a different instruction, or is interrupted by the operating system.
 As of 2015, most personal computers, smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together,
 and computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past.

The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages.
 They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to natural languages than machine languages.
 High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler or an interpreter or a combination of the two.
 Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language,
 which has strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an assembler.

<h3>  Programming language</h3>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of machine code output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.

Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos. The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.

Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).

The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.
